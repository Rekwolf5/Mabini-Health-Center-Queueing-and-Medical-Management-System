# ðŸ”§ Fix Cache Error - Quick Solution

## The Problem
Laravel is trying to use database caching but the `cache` table doesn't exist.

## âœ… Quick Fix - Switch to File Cache

### Step 1: Update .env file
Change your cache driver from database to file:

\`\`\`env
CACHE_STORE=file
CACHE_PREFIX=
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Clear config and try again
\`\`\`bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
\`\`\`

## Alternative: Create Cache Table

If you want to keep database caching:

\`\`\`bash
# Create cache table migration
php artisan cache:table

# Run the migration
php artisan migrate

# Then clear cache
php artisan cache:clear
\`\`\`

## Recommended: Use File Cache for Development

For development, file cache is simpler and doesn't require database tables.
