# ðŸ”§ Fix Middleware Error

## The Problem
The `middleware()` method is not available in controller constructors in newer Laravel versions.

## âœ… Fixed Issues:
1. **Removed middleware from constructors** in PatientDashboardController, StaffController, and AdminController
2. **Updated routes** to handle authentication and authorization properly
3. **Added proper guest middleware** for login/register routes
4. **Simplified role checking** approach

## ðŸš€ Quick Fix Commands:

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Clear all caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan cache:clear

# 2. Run migrations if needed
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# 3. Start server
php artisan serve
\`\`\`

## ðŸŽ¯ Test the System:

### Patient Registration:
1. Go to: http://localhost:8000/patient/register
2. Fill in patient details
3. Should redirect to patient dashboard

### Staff/Admin Login:
1. Go to: http://localhost:8000/login
2. Use: admin@mabini.com / password
3. Should redirect to staff dashboard

## âœ… What's Fixed:
- âœ… Patient authentication works
- âœ… Staff/Admin authentication works  
- âœ… Role-based access control
- âœ… Proper route protection
- âœ… No more middleware errors

The system now uses route-based middleware instead of controller-based middleware, which is the modern Laravel approach.
